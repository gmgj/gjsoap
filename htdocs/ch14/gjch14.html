&rsaquo; What is Xdebug? What useful features does it provide?
Xdebug is a PHP extension which provides debugging and profiling capabilities.
It uses the DBGp debugging protocol.

The debug information that Xdebug can provide includes the following:

    stack and function traces in error messages with:

        full parameter display for user defined functions
        function name, file name and line indications
        support for member functions

    memory allocation
    protection for infinite recursions

Xdebug also provides:

    profiling information for PHP scripts
    code coverage analysis
    capabilities to debug your scripts interactively with a debugger front-end.

Xdebug is also available via the PECL library.

&rsaquo; What is unit testing? What are the benefits of unit testing?
The premise of unit testing is that you define tests to confirm that particular bits of code work
as needed. Here are a few of the benefits of unit testing:

Tests will minimize bugs (this is the most obvious benefit).
Tests can help you improve your design.
Tests can assist in creating documentation for your code.
You are less likely to break code and introduce errors as you make changes down the line.

What are some of the properties that unit tests should exhibit?
I write tests that call the use code in the most common way and with exception condtions.
I continually add to and expand upon the test code.

&rsaquo; What is TDD?
test-driven development (TDD).
you define your tests and then write code that passes those tests.

</pre>


<p class="hrc"></p>

&rsaquo; What are assertions?
Confirm that this is the case.
assertContains( $needle, $haystack);
Because this is an assertion, this test would fail if the needle is not found within the haystack.
This is functionally equivalent to
if (!in_array( $needle, $haystack)) {
     echo 'The test has failed!';
}

How do you invoke the assertion methods within the test class?
        $this->assertEquals($this->_data, file_get_contents($this->_file));

&rsaquo;How do you create a test suite?
Begin a new PHP script in your text editor or IDE, to be named XXXXXX.php

you create a test suite by extending the PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase class:

class SomeClassTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase { }
Conventionally, you'll name the new class a combination of the name of the class being tested,
followed by Test.

</pre>

<p class="hrc"></p>
<pre>


&rsaquo; How do you create a test case (a suite of tests) using PHPUnit?
         How do you create an individual test?

Within this class, create one new public method for each test.
Each method's name should start with test: function testSomething()

</pre>

&rsaquo; What is profiling? What is webgrind?
Profiling is the process of analyzing a script to see where there may be performance problems: slow bits of code and process bottlenecks.

webgrind reads the xdebug profiling information whcih is stored using the
'cachegrind' format.

Change php.ini
xdebug.profiler_enable = 1
xdebug.profiler_output_name = cachegrind.out.%t.%p
xdebug.profiler_output_dir to a writable temporary directory .


</pre>

<p class="hrc"></p>
<pre>

&rsaquo; What kinds of things should you be watching for in profile data?
Start by
looking at two possible indicators of inefficiency:

&rsaquo; Processes that take disproportionately more time than the others
&rsaquo; Processes that take disproportionately more time than they should

You should not focus on the specific amount of time different bits of code require to execute.
Those times are unlikely to be that accurate.
At the very least, the mere act of profiling a script is going to drag down its performance.
Instead,
&rsaquo; at the time a process takes relative to the whole script.
There will be processes that you would expect to take a lot of time, but there will
also be those that shouldn't.

&rsaquo; at the first category in hopes of making significant gains;
&rsaquo; at the second because something may be amiss.

In particular, input/ output operations will normally be the most expensive:
Working with files
Interacting with databases
Networking (i.e., communicating with other servers)
Interacting with the server (this includes working with files and databases,
of course, as well as sending emails, calling other utilities, and so forth)
